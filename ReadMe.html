<h3>xWhois v1.0</h3>
<p>This is a simple mod and block combo that allows you to add Whois search capabilities to your site.<br><br>
There are 2 types of blocks with html templates.  The first block looks best as a side, the second block looks
best as a center.  Choose the style you like!</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Copy the package to your Xoops modules directory and install as any other module.  There are no databases.  
This is a very simple module and block php code section.</p>
<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>sloppycode.com created the class file used to interrogate the internic database.  There were some minor modifications
to get it to work under XOOPS, but credit goes where credit is due.  Don't even know if this site is still
around.
